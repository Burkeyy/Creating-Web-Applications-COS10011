      <h2>Canvas - What is it?</h2>

      <p>
        Canvas is a cloud-based learning management system (LMS). Learning
        management systems are software applications typically used in a
        corporate or educational market. In the case of Canvas, it is a
        streamlined method of administering online courses, making education
        easier to access by students, whether itâ€™s for learning purposes or for
        feedback on their efforts. For educators and teachers, Canvas allows for
        a simpler and more effective way of managing the course for their
        students.
